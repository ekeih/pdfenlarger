pdfenlarger
===========

Sometimes you need additional white space in your PDF-file. (e.g. for taking notes in Xournal)  
pdfenlarger will do this for you. Just choose the size of the additional space.  
You can also pass a side where the additional space should be added. (Default is right.)  

usage: `pdfenlarger.sh <input.pdf> <output.pdf> <additional_space> [top|right|bottom|left]`  
example: `pdfenlarger.sh input.pdf output.pdf 200 left`
